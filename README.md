The NASA Space Apps Challenge is an annual international hackathon-style event organized by NASA (the National Aeronautics and Space Administration) in collaboration with various partners. It brings together people from all over the world interested in space, science, and technology to work on innovative solutions to real-world problems related to space exploration and Earth science. It's a competition, a learning experience, and a way for space enthusiasts and innovators to contribute to NASA's missions and scientific endeavors.
