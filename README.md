The NASA Space Apps Challenge is an annual international hackathon-style event organized by NASA (the National Aeronautics and Space Administration) in collaboration with various partners. It brings together individuals from all over the world who share an interest in space, science, and technology to collaborate on innovative solutions for real-world challenges in space exploration and Earth science. This event serves as a competition, a valuable learning experience, and an opportunity for space enthusiasts and innovators to contribute to NASA's missions and scientific endeavors. We are thrilled and honored to participate in this global competition!

Our team has focused on the project STAR: Revolutionizing Technical Standards with AI, aiming to "create a copilot" for mission designers, enabling them to embark on missions with greater confidence, knowing they have met all necessary requirements. We have developed an AI application that assists mission designers in crafting mission requirements for space missions, consisting of both back-end and front-end components. Our ultimate objective is to enhance the capabilities of AI and provide valuable guidance to mission designers.

This website serves as a software setup guide, and we're excited to make a significant impact in this endeavor! Let's rock it!
